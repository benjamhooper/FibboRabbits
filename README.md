# FibboRabbits


User Story: As a new rabbit rancher, starting out with 2 baby rabbits, I need to know how many rabbits to expect to have after a given number of months so that I can order the right amount of rabbit food since I always have to order several months in advance.

Assumptions:

1. Rabbit populations expand monthly according to the Fibonacci sequence (Use Fibonacci sequence starting with 1 not 0)

2. The number of rabbits alive is 2 times the Fibonacci number at position m where m is a number of months.

3. Rabbits do not die.

Task:

1. Allow User to input a Month m.

2. Calculate the Number of Rabbits alive after m Months according to the assumptions above.

3. Display the total rabbit population after m Months.
